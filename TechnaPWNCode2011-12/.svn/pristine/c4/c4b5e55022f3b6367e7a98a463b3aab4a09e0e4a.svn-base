Things this code does:

Gets the input.
Processes the Autonomous
Outputs to motors.



Initialize variables

If we're in the Initialize-next-step mode:
Determine whether or not we are even running autonomous in order to have a no autonomous (this can be scrapped in favor of a "No Autonomous" Routine)

Display the Current Autonomous Routine, step number, and Step name on the screen

Figure out if motor values should be changed based on step data, and if so, mark them to be changed (Should move this to the executing-step-until-trip-condition mode)

Reset timers, encoders, and gyro sensors to a zero value in order to measure progress of these things during the step.

Exit out of the Initialize-next-step mode in order to be in the executing-step-until-trip-condition mode

If we're in the Executing-step-until-trip-condition mode:

If we're on the last step, then stop motors. (Eliminate the need for this by making a separate mode (or state) called Waiting-for-usercontrol-mode)

Check to see if the joystick has moved. If so, exit autonomous.

Again, if we're in the Initialize-next-step mode:

If the step says to jump to another step, and if the conditions have been met for that jump, then jump.
